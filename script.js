/**
 * store the gameboard as an array inside of a Gameboard object
 * Your players are also going to be stored in objects
 * object to control the flow of the game itself.
 * main goal here is to have as little global code as possible
 * write a JavaScript function that will render the contents of the gameboard array to the webpage
 * Build the functions that allow players to add marks to a specific spot on the board
 * Each little piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects
 * Build the logic that checks for when the game is over! Should check for 3-in-a-row and a tie.
 * Clean up the interface to allow players to put in their names
 * include a button to start/restart the game
 * add a display element that congratulates the winning player!
 * Optional - If youâ€™re feeling ambitious create an AI so that a player can play against the computer!
